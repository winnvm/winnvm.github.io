## What is WinNvm?

WinNvm is NodeJS version manager for windows. It is similar to [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) but not a fork.

## Why another NodeJS Version Manager?

The short answer is because it can be. The long answer is I what to do some modification to nvm-windows but not too comfortable with GoLang so I started a new project in C# because I'm from Java background so C# is much easier than GoLang.
